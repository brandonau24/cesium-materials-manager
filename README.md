# Cesium Materials Manager

I used node v12.18.2 at the time of implementing this. This projet definitely took me longer than 2-3 hours. If I were to guess, I probably spent a 10 hours on it.

My biggest mistake was probably spending an hour on the webpack configuration.

## How to run
1. In one terminal, go into the api directory and run `node api.js`. This will start the mock API server.
2. At the root of this project, start the webpack development server with `yarn dev`
